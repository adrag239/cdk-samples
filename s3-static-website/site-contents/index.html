            The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define your
            cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.

            Provisioning cloud applications can be a challenging process that requires you to perform manual actions,
            write custom scripts, maintain templates, or learn domain-specific languages. AWS CDK uses the familiarity
            and expressive power of programming languages for modeling your applications. It provides high-level
            components called constructs that preconfigure cloud resources with proven defaults, so you can build cloud
            applications with ease. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS
            CloudFormation. It also allows you to compose and share your own custom constructs incorporating your
            organization's requirements, helping you expedite new projects.
